# standalone

The _standalone_ distribution ships a single Bash executable that can run independently.

## Pros

* Simply download and run, requires no installation

## Cons

* Does not ship dependencies and requires the user to have them installed independently
* Cannot auto-update
* (When implemented in the future) cannot support I18N
