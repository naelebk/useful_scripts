           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Cog: Containers for machine learning

Cog is an open-source tool that lets you package machine learning models in a standard, production-ready container.

You can deploy your packaged model to your own infrastructure, or to [Replicate](https://replicate.com/).

## Highlights

- 📦 **Docker containers without the pain.** Writing your own `Dockerfile` can be a bewildering process. With Cog, you define your environment with a [simple configuration file](#how-it-works) and it generates a Docker image with all the best practices: Nvidia base images, efficient caching of dependencies, installing specific Python versions, sensible environment variable defaults, and so on.

- 🤬️ **No more CUDA hell.** Cog knows which CUDA/cuDNN/PyTorch/Tensorflow/Python combos are compatible and will set it all up correctly for you.

- ✅ **Define the inputs and outputs for your model with standard Python.** Then, Cog generates an OpenAPI schema and validates the inputs and outputs with Pydantic.

- 🎁 **Automatic HTTP prediction server**: Your model's types are used to dynamically generate a RESTful HTTP API using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

- 🥞 **Automatic queue worker.** Long-running deep learning models or batch processing is best architected with a queue. Cog models do this out of the box. Redis is currently supported, with more in the pipeline.

- ☁️ **Cloud storage.** Files can be read and written directly to Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage. (Coming soon.)

- 🚀 **Ready for production.** Deploy your model anywhere that Docker images run. Your own infrastructure, or [Replicate](https://replicate.com).

## How it works

Define the Docker environment your model runs in with `cog.yaml`:

```yaml
build:
  gpu: true
  system_packages:
    - "libgl1-mesa-glx"
    - "libglib2.0-0"
  python_version: "3.11"
  python_packages:
    - "torch==1.8.1"
predict: "predict.py:Predictor"
```

Define how predictions are run on your model with `predict.py`:

```python
from cog import BasePredictor, Input, Path
import torch

class Predictor(BasePredictor):
    def setup(self):
        """Load the model into memory to make running multiple predictions efficient"""
        self.model = torch.load("./weights.pth")

    # The arguments and types the model takes as input
    def predict(self,
          image: Path = Input(description="Grayscale input image")
    ) -> Path:
        """Run a single prediction on the model"""
        processed_image = preprocess(image)
        output = self.model(processed_image)
        return postprocess(output)
```

Now, you can run predictions on this model:

```console
$ cog predict -i image=@input.jpg
--> Building Docker image...
--> Running Prediction...
--> Output written to output.jpg
```

Or, build a Docker image for deployment:

```console
$ cog build -t my-colorization-model
--> Building Docker image...
--> Built my-colorization-model:latest

$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --gpus all my-colorization-model

$ curl http://localhost:5000/predictions -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"input": {"image": "https://.../input.jpg"}}'
```

<!-- NOTE (bfirsh): Development environment instructions intentionally left out of readme for now, so as not to confuse the "ship a model to production" message.

In development, you can also run arbitrary commands inside the Docker environment:

```console
$ cog run python train.py
...
```

Or, [spin up a Jupyter notebook](docs/notebooks.md):

```console
$ cog run -p 8888 jupyter notebook --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0
```
-->

## Why are we building this?

It's really hard for researchers to ship machine learning models to production.

Part of the solution is Docker, but it is so complex to get it to work: Dockerfiles, pre-/post-processing, Flask servers, CUDA versions. More often than not the researcher has to sit down with an engineer to get the damn thing deployed.

[Andreas](https://github.com/andreasjansson) and [Ben](https://github.com/bfirsh) created Cog. Andreas used to work at Spotify, where he built tools for building and deploying ML models with Docker. Ben worked at Docker, where he created [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).

We realized that, in addition to Spotify, other companies were also using Docker to build and deploy machine learning models. [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-pyml/) and others have built similar systems. So, we're making an open source version so other people can do this too.

Hit us up if you're interested in using it or want to collaborate with us. [We're on Discord](https://discord.gg/replicate) or email us at [team@replicate.com](mailto:team@replicate.com).

## Prerequisites

- **macOS, Linux or Windows 11**. Cog works on macOS, Linux and Windows 11 with [WSL 2](docs/wsl2/wsl2.md)
- **Docker**. Cog uses Docker to create a container for your model. You'll need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before you can run Cog.

## Install

<a id="upgrade"></a>

If you're using macOS, you can install Cog using Homebrew:

```console
brew install cog
```

You can also download and install the latest release of Cog
directly from GitHub by running the following commands in a terminal:

```console
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/cog -L "https://github.com/replicate/cog/releases/latest/download/cog_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m)"
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cog
```

Alternatively, you can build Cog from source and install it with these commands:

```console
make
sudo make install
```
